Good morning sir!
Here is your daily update for Thursday, July 10, 2025, starting with blogs summaries for top channels, followed by Key Ongoing Learning's KOL's.


Kicking off our blogs, for YC today, we highlight Bret Victor on why current trend of AIs is at odds with his work

Bret Victor critiques the current trend of AI development, arguing that it conflicts with his vision of empowering individuals through interactive technology. He emphasizes that many AI systems prioritize automation and decision-making by machines, which can undermine human creativity and understanding. Victor advocates for tools that enhance human capabilities and foster exploration and learning, rather than replacing human effort with AI-driven solutions. He believes that such systems should support users in actively engaging with information, encouraging personal insights and discoveries. Victor's perspective highlights a need for a balance between technological advancement and the preservation of human agency in the creative process.

Now on to some engineering facts,

For Stunt Rigging, we have Stunt rigging in film and TV involves intricate setups using cables, pulleys, and harnesses to safely execute high-risk stunts. Professionals, known as stunt riggers, collaborate closely with stunt coordinators to create realistic sequences while prioritizing safety, often utilizing computer simulations for precision before filming begins.

For History of the Bike, we have Dirt bikes originated in the 1930s when motorcycle enthusiasts began modifying standard street bikes for off-road riding. The first recognized dirt bike is the 1938 "Greeves," designed for trials competitions. However, the real boom in popularity came in the 1960s with the introduction of lightweight, versatile models like the Honda SL350. Street motorcycles, on the other hand, evolved from early 20th-century machines used for transportation and racing. By the 1970s, the rise of iconic brands like Harley-Davidson and Kawasaki solidified the motorcycle’s place in popular culture, paving the way for today's diverse motorcycle landscape.

For space travel, we have In 1980, NASA did not have any launches, but a significant event in the space program occurred just a year later.

This historic mission demonstrated the shuttle's capabilities and paved the way for future missions, making space travel more accessible and reusable. The shuttle program ultimately transformed the landscape of human spaceflight, with a total of 135 missions conducted until its retirement in 2011.

For General Contractor Knowledge, One crucial aspect of both commercial and residential development is understanding the importance of zoning laws and land use regulations. Zoning laws dictate how land can be used in a particular area, establishing guidelines for building types, their size, height, and the density of development. For a general contractor, it is vital to familiarize themselves with the local zoning ordinances before commencing a project. This knowledge not only ensures compliance with legal requirements but can also significantly impact the project's feasibility and design. For instance, if a contractor is looking to build a multi-family unit in an area zoned for single-family homes, this could result in costly redesigns or even project cancellation.

Additionally, securing the necessary permits and approvals is a critical step in the development process. A general contractor must navigate through various permits, which can include building permits, environmental permits, and occupancy permits, depending on the project's scope and location. This process often involves submitting detailed plans and specifications to the relevant authorities for review. Delays in obtaining these permits can

Hepatitis B vaccine was a major development of 1980, First vaccine produced using recombinant DNA technology.
